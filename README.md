One of our main goal with [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) **2.0** is to make it easy to theme the components with as little changes as possible to the components themselves.

*General Syntax of NativeBase Component*

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-jsx">import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Container, Button, Text } from 'native-base';
â€‹
export default class IconExample extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            &lt;Container>
                &lt;Button>
                    &lt;Text>
                        Button
                    &lt;/Text>
                &lt;/Button>
            &lt;/Container>
        );
    }
}</code></pre>
