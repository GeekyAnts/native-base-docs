# Quick Setup

To have [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) components running onto your native apps, all you need to do is, create a fresh [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) project and install the NativeBase using *npm*.

**System Requirements**
* Globally installed [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 6.0
* Globally installed [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) >= 4.0
* Globally installed [React Native CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) which allow you to easily create and initialize projects.   
* [Click here](/docs/Compatibility.md) to know about React Native version compatibility with NativeBase.

## Setup with React Native

```js
react-native init AwesomeNativeBase
cd AwesomeNativeBase
```

*Install NativeBase*

```js
npm install native-base --save
```

*Install Peer Dependencies*<br />
The peer dependencies included from any npm packages does not automatically get installed. Your application will not depend on it explicitly.

```js
react-native link
```

You've successfully setup [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) with your [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app. Your React Native app is ready to run on iOS and Android devices.

Check out the [NativeBase KitchenSink](https://nativebase.io/kitchen-sink-app) an example of NativeBase components implementation. Here's the [source code](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase-KitchenSink) for NativeBase KitchenSink.

<hr />







## Setup with Expo
Expo helps you make React Native apps with no build configuration. It works on macOS, Windows, and Linux. <br />
Refer this link for additional information on [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/)

*Install NativeBase*
```js
yarn add native-base
```

NativeBase use some custom fonts that can be loaded using **Font.loadAsync** function. Check out the [Expo Font documentation](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/font/).
<br />

*Install Expo Fonts*
```bash
expo install expo-font
```

*App.js* <br />
```js
import React from 'react';
import { AppLoading } from 'expo';
import { Container, Text } from 'native-base';
import * as Font from 'expo-font';
import { Ionicons } from '@expo/vector-icons';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      isReady: false,
    };
  }

  async componentDidMount() {
    await Font.loadAsync({
      Roboto: require('native-base/Fonts/Roboto.ttf'),
      Roboto_medium: require('native-base/Fonts/Roboto_medium.ttf'),
      ...Ionicons.font,
    });
    this.setState({ isReady: true });
  }

  render() {
    if (!this.state.isReady) {
      return <AppLoading />;
    }

    return (
      <Container>
        <Text>Open up App.js to start working on your app!</Text>
      </Container>
    );
  }
}
```
<br />
Check out the [KitchenSink](https://expo.io/@geekyants/nativebasekitchensink) with Expo for an example of the implementation.<br />
Find the [KitchenSink repo here](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase-KitchenSink/tree/CRNA)

## Setup with Web


```
npm install -g create-react-app
npx create-react-app nativebase-app
cd nativebase-app
npm i native-base react-art react-native-web --save
npm i react-app-rewired customize-cra @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties --dev --save
```

* **Replace scripts in package.json**

```
"scripts": {
    "start": "react-app-rewired start",
    "build": "react-app-rewired build",
    "test": "react-app-rewired test",
}
```
* **Create file config-overrides.js at root of your project**

```
const path = require('path');
const {
  override,
  addWebpackAlias,
  babelInclude,
  addBabelPlugins
} = require('customize-cra');

module.exports = override(
  addWebpackAlias({
    "react-native/Libraries/Renderer/shims/ReactNativePropRegistry": "react-native-web/dist/modules/ReactNativePropRegistry",
    "react-native": "react-native-web"
  }),
  babelInclude([
    path.resolve('src'),
    path.resolve('node_modules/native-base-shoutem-theme'),
    path.resolve('node_modules/react-navigation'),
    path.resolve('node_modules/react-native-easy-grid'),
    path.resolve('node_modules/react-native-drawer'),
    path.resolve('node_modules/react-native-safe-area-view'),
    path.resolve('node_modules/react-native-vector-icons'),
    path.resolve('node_modules/react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view'),
    path.resolve('node_modules/react-native-web'),
    path.resolve('node_modules/react-native-tab-view'),
    path.resolve('node_modules/static-container'),
  ]),
  addBabelPlugins(
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties"
  ),
);
```

* **Include Icons**

    Copy [font.css](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase-KitchenSink/blob/web-support/src/font.css) to App.css


* **Run**

```
npm start
```
OR
```
yarn start
```

Check out the [NativeBase KitchenSink](https://nativebase.io/kitchen-sink-web-app) with Web support for an example of NativeBase components implementation. Here's the [source code](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase-KitchenSink/tree/web-support) for NativeBase KitchenSink.

## Setup with Vue Native

```js
npm install -g vue-native-cli
vue-native init AwesomeNativeBase               // Initializes crna project
vue-native init AwesomeNativeBase --no-crna     // Initializes react-native project
cd AwesomeNativeBase
```


*Install NativeBase*

```js
npm install native-base --save
```

*Register NativeBase components*
```
import Vue from "vue-native-core";
import { VueNativeBase } from "native-base";

// registering all native-base components to the global scope of the Vue
Vue.use(VueNativeBase);
```
Vue Native components are very similar to React Native components. You can use all the React Native components, by making use of the `kebab case` (hyphen-delimited) equivalent components. This is because Vue Native is a wrapper around the React Native APIs.

To use NativeBase components with Vue Native, follow the same pattern, `kebab case`. And prefix NativeBase components with `nb-`

**Run**

```
npm start
```

You've successfully setup [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) with your [Vue Native](https://vue-native.io) app. Your Vue Native app is ready to run on iOS and Android devices.

Check out [Vue Native Docs](https://vue-native.io/docs/installation.html). Also, NativeBase KitchenSink, an example of NativeBase components implementation with Vue Native, [source code](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/KitchenSink-Vue-Native) is here.
