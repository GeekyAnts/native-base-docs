## Theming NativeBase Apps

##### Steps to be followed to customize NativeBase:
* Run this command from your terminal after installing native-base.

    `node node_modules/native-base/ejectTheme.js`

* All the theme files and variables get added to your project root. Change the variables or theme files.
* Wrap the code or component to which you want to apply the theme with **StyleProvider**.
* Pass the variable i.e., `platform/material/commonColors.js` as the parameter of theme function, which is passed as a value to style prop of component **StyleProvider**.
* The theme you pass should be a function.

Now your project is ready for theme customization.
<br />

## What are themes and variables and how to change them?
- When you run `node node_modules/native-base/ejectTheme.js` from your terminal, a folder named **native-base-theme** gets copied to your project root. Inside the directory are two folders named **components** and **variables**.
- The **components** folder contain the theme styling files for all the components. This is where you would change the style properties of the components if you need to.

Example, if you need to change the height of Button component, you'll need to change this line in `native-base-theme/components/Button.js`.
- The **variables** folder contain three preset theme variables. You can change the variables (for color, fontFamily, iconFamily etc) for a uniform look and feel throughout your app. <br />

##### Three themes to start with
NativeBase is packed with three preset themes. <br />
* **Platform:** The default theme of NativeBase which maps to the design of the platform where the app runs.
* **Material:** Sometimes, you need Material design for both the platforms. Not everyone is a fan but Google does use Material design on iOS. This theme is not 100% material yet but, it can be used today. <br />
* **Common Colors:** Most of the brands use a common color scheme for both the platforms but they also follow platform specific icons, font and orientation of the components. Common Colors theme is best suited for such use-cases. <br />

*Syntax to add Material Design*
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-jsx">import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Container, Content, Text, StyleProvider } from 'native-base';
import getTheme from './native-base-theme/components';
import material from './native-base-theme/variables/material';
â€‹export default class ThemeExample extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;StyleProvider style={getTheme(material)}>
        &lt;Container>
          &lt;Content>
            &lt;Text>
              I have changed the text color.
            &lt;/Text>
          &lt;/Content>
        &lt;/Container>
      &lt;/StyleProvider>
    );
  }
}</code></pre><br />

* The <code>&lt;StyleProvider></code> with theme can be applied to any component of NativeBase.
* The theme holds good with all its descendants.
* The above code for theme change works this way:<br />
Go to `native-base-theme/variables/platform.js` and modify color code for **textColor**.
* Similarly you can customize theme for rest of the NativeBase components by modifying color code of their respective attributes, some of which are explained below.
