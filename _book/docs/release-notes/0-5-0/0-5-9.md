### [0.5.9](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/releases/tag/v0.5.9)


#### New Features
* **Deck Swiper:** Tinder-like swipe cards to select/reject data set with features to swipe left and right.
* **Generate Image from Icon:** Genrates an Image resource for NativeBase Icons.
* **filter() for null value:** Usually if a null value is passed as a child to Component, it throws few errors. This .filter() removes all falsey values from this.props.children, preventing the errors, and returning the correct result.


#### Upgraded Features
* **FooterTab:** Added onPress support for elements of FooterTab.
* **InputGroup:** Allows null block inside InputGroup Component.
* **Tabs:**
  * Help to switch between the Tabs component programatically. Say **page = 1**.   
  * Ensures that Tabs component's props.children is an array, else creates a single item array if it is not. Thus allows calls to .filter() and .map().
* **ES Lint:** Config ESLint (airbnb) to enforce coding style.


#### Bug Fixes
* **Picker:** Updates <i>Picker.Item</i> value dynamically.
* **Keyboard-aware-scroll-view:**
  * **resetScrollToCoords:** This is user definable prop. Coordinates that will be used to reset the scroll when the keyboard hides. Also restores scroll position after keyboard hides if <i>resetScrollToCoords</i> is not set.
  * **disableKBDismissScroll:** Disables automatic scroll on focus.
* **Content:** Eliminates margin on the top of Content which includes any fields inside of it.
