# Why NativeBase?
#### What does NativeBase do?

[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is a mobile application development framework which enables developers to use [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) to build native mobile applications running on the major mobile platforms - Apple iOS and Google Android. The applications stack of components is built using native UI components and because of that, there are no compromises with the User Experience of the applications. [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is targeted specially on the look and feel, and UI interplay of your app. [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) without a doubt fits in well with mobile applications which cut downs one huge part of your app The Front end.


#### What makes NativeBase unique?

[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) uses the [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) platform's default rendering and layout engine to display the UI of the application. This means that the applications that use the [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) framework are exposing exactly the same UX as natively written applications. With [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) your application logic is written and runs in JavaScript, whereas your application UI is fully native; therefore you have none of the compromises typically associated with HTML5 UI.

** *The hymn of React Native — learn once, write anywhere.* **

The paradigm employed by the [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) allows to use native iOS and Android components, and bring about changes to the UI through a JavaScript thread running in the background. Developers use [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) as it allows them to have a common codebase for all their application code. It doesn’t force developers to reinvent the wheel every time they circulate from platform to platform.


#### Why should I learn NativeBase?

[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) gives you the potential of building applications that run on iOS and Android using a single codebase. [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) is our choice for the application language.<br />
It’s tough to overlook [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), as it's so far one of the fastest-developing mobile app development that essentially permits you to create a isolated product with often outcomes. [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) apps seem to run simply as speedy as native apps. [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) simply takes charge of the view controllers and programmatically generates native views using javascript. This means that you can have all the speed and power of a native application, with the ease of development that comes with React.<br />
What is really great is that you can use shared UI cross-platform components, which will drastically increase your productivity. When using [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/), you can use any native third-party libraries out of the box. You do not need to use wrappers or do any other actions. The new additions to the native platform are available immediately.
[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) provides amazing support for adding components, so that you will by no means hit a lifeless stop.


#### Is it difficult to learn NativeBase?

[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) aims to get you up to speed with writing iOS and Android apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). NativeBase has a basic setup explained [here](./GetStarted.md)
NativeBase provides you with detailed description and working of components in its [documentation](./components/README.md).


#### What language is NativeBase written with?

[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is written with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and JavaScript.


#### How much does NativeBase cost?

[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is open source and free.


#### What skillset is required to get started with NativeBase?

[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is an open source framework which allows programmers build native iOS and Android application with JavaScript.<br />
To start implementing applications with [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/), you should be familiar with the JavaScript language.<br />
Rest of the things, NativeBase takes care for you.


#### What devices and OS versions is NativeBase compatible with?

* [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) works on OS X which is needed for iOS development.
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)  is the recommended way to install Watchman and Flow.
* We recommend installing [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html), otherwise you might hit a node   file watching bug.
* Periodically run <code>brew update && brew upgrade</code> to keep your programs up-to-date.
* iOS Setup: [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/) 7.0 or higher is required.
* Android Setup: Install the [Android SDK](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html) (and an Android emulator if you want to work on your app without having to use a physical device).
* NOTE: <i>NativeBase is compatible with all those devices and OS versions, which React Native holds good. There is experimental Windows and Linux support from React Native community for Android development.</i>


#### How does NativeBase run my JavaScript code on iOS and Android?

When using [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/), you're going to be running your JavaScript code in two environments:
* On iOS simulators and devices, Android emulators and devices; [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) uses [JavaScriptCore](http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/JavaScriptCore) which is the JavaScript engine that powers Safari.
On iOS JSC doesn't use JIT due to the absence of writable executable memory in iOS apps.
* When using Chrome debugging, it runs all the JavaScript code within Chrome itself and communicates with native code via WebSocket.
So you are using [V8](https://developers.google.com/v8/).
