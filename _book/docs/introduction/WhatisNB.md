# What is NativeBase?


[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is a free and open source framework that enables developers to build high-quality mobile apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) iOS and Android apps with a fusion of [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features). <br />[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) builds a layer on top of [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) that provides you with basic set of components for mobile application development. This helps you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms.

> #### The focus of React Native — learn once, write anywhere.

[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), allows you to implement the standard platform components which includes UITabBar on iOS and Drawer on Android. This gives your app a consistent look and feel with the rest of the platform ecosystem, and keeps the quality bar high. These components are easily incorporated into your app using their [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) and React component counterparts, such as TabBarIOS and DrawerLayoutAndroid.

#### Cross-platform feature

If you are making an Android app alongside your iOS app, [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) helps you to use much of the same core logic. The introduced advantage of being able to write for all the logic code inside the same language is exceptional. This helps of not having to shift context between platforms.

#### Renders Native views

Only Native views, no Webview here.<br />
This means, all the browser compatibility issues go away which also enhances the performance with super smooth animations.<br /><br />

#### Speed of development

By means of Live-Reload

#### About the language

[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) is our choice for the application language. This makes use of babel to transpile [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) and ES7 code, with JSX and flow type annotations. JavaScriptCore is used to run JavaScript on the device, maintaining the software size low. With this, the code becomes so much less complicated than it will likely be in simple javascript.<br /><br />

#### Declarative Nature of [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/)

[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is a mixture of Javascript and markup tied together within the return portion of a function. Even styling can live in the same file as the rest of your component, this makes for an incredibly speedy iteration cycle.<br /><br />
